# Java Web Scraper with Jsoup

## Overview
This repository houses a Java-based web scraper that leverages the Jsoup library to efficiently extract data from HTML documents.

This project was completed as part of my Operating Systems class.

## Features
- **Link Extraction**: Fetches and extracts hyperlinks from specified web pages using recursion.
- **HTML Parsing**: Utilizes Jsoup for effective parsing and manipulation of HTML content.
- **Thread Management**: Manages multiple scraping operations using Java's threading capabilities.
- **URL Handling**: Adjusts and modifies relative and absolute URLs for usability in scraping tasks.

## Prerequisites
